Biquadris is a Latinization of the game Tetris. This game was built as part of the final project for the course CS246 - Object-Oriented Software Development, offered at the University of Waterloo in the term Winter 2022. We worked in a group of 3 to complete this final project over the span of one and a half weeks. Unfortunately, due to the University's policy, I am not allowed to post the source code publicly.
